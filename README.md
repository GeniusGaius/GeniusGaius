# 👋 Hi, I’m John Gaius Maichibi

## Data Analyst | Insight-Driven Storyteller | Excel, SQL & Power BI Specialist

Welcome to my corner of the data world.

I’m a data analyst passionate about turning raw data into meaningful, human stories that drive decisions, shape strategies, and solve real business problems. My journey didn’t start in a lab or with lines of code—it started with a question: *Why do some businesses make smarter decisions than others?*

That question led me here—working with tools like **Excel**, **Power BI**, and **SQL**, analyzing patterns across marketing, retail, e-commerce, hospitality, and customer behavior.
